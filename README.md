# Sneaky

Can we make money by buying sneakers low on one platform and selling high on another?

**Sneaky** is a prototype with multi-venue feed, price-margin-based strategy and history / volume / volatility analytics tooling for trading sneakers on consignment stores and exchanges.

Sneaky系统从多个平台 (毒app，StockX) 抓取球鞋价格数据、存储，并决定哪些款式有合适的价差、volatility、volume，提供倒卖建议。

### What to expect

* Feed
  * Scrapes venues for current price listing and historical transactions.
  * Three main modes of operation:
    * **Query**: given search terms, scrape models on a venue, record static information (e.g. style ID, title, release date, product ID / URL query key on the venue, __feed/static_info_serializer.py__).
    * Update: given static info produced by query, dump current price readings and transactions since the last update to local file system (__feed/time_series_serializer.py__).
    * **Study**: given style ID and size, query a venue for current listing prices and historical transactions data.
  * Venues:
    * **Du** (__feed/du_feed.py__, fully implemented): scrapes Du WeChat app for product detail and transaction history.
    * **StockX** (__feed/stockx_feed.js__, fully implemented): scrapes StockX (web service) for current best bid and offer.
    * **Flightclub** (__flightclub/__, on v1): scrapy-based crawler to parse sell prices from FlightClub webpage.
    * **Goat** (not implemented).
    * **Ebay** (not pursued, low match rate and lack of authenticity guarantee would greatly hurt automation).
* Strategy
  * Given time series data feed produced and a configurable set of options, print the most lucrative models for purchase (__strategy/strategy.py__).
* Analytics
  * Given time series data and a model, print stats or plot historical transactions (__feed/du_analyzer.py__).

* Model of operation
  * Run query every month / year to account for new releases and potential changes in (StyleID, platform-specific ID) map.
  * After scraping static info from multiple venues, run a join to produce items for which we have data on multiple venues (__feed/csv_merge.py__)
  * Run update every day to produce a sample of today's prices and record transactions since yesterday.
  * Run strategy whenever you want to see its recommendations based off of currently recorded readings.
  * Before making a purchase, run analytics to double check its volume, volatility and historical transaction prices.

### How to run

* Dependencies
* Create credentials
* Feed
```sh
# Du product details => du.mapping.{now}.csv
./du_feed.py --mode query --kw ../stockx/query_kw.txt --pages 20

# StockX product details => stockx.mapping.{now}.csv
# This is recommended to circumvent an antibot mechanism enforced by StockX
./stockx_query.sh

# Merge
./csv_merge.py --output merged.20191225.csv stockx.20191225.csv du.mapping.20191221-150959.csv 

# Du current listing and historical transactions => data/{model}/{size}.json
./du_feed.py --mode update --start_from merged.20191225.csv --transaction_history_date 20190801 --transaction_history_maxpage 20 --min_interval_seconds 3600

# StockX current listing and historical transactions => data/{model}/{size}.json
# This is recommended to circumvent an anti-bot mechanism enforced by StockX
./stockx_update.sh merged.20191225.csv
```
* Strategy
```sh
# Time series price/transaction data data/{model}/{size}.json => recommendations
./strategy.py --start_from ../feed/merged.20191225.csv
```
* Analytics
```sh
# plot Du historical transaction prices
./du_analyzer.py --style_id 881426-009 --size 7.0 --mode plot

# product Du historical transaction statistics
./du_analyzer.py --style_id 881426-009 --size 7.0 --mode stats
```
